# Polynomial_Regression
## Definition
Polynomial Regression is a method used to predict an outcome (dependent variable) based on a curved relationship with one or more input values (independent variables).
> Imagine you want to draw a smooth curve through scattered points on a graph—this method allows you to do that by creating a mathematical equation with powers of the input values (like squares, cubes, etc.).

## Simple Example
>If you're trying to predict the growth of a plant based on the amount of water given, but the growth pattern isn't a straight line (like more water always equals more growth), a curved line might describe the relationship better. Polynomial Regression can model that curve.
